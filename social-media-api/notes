Traditional: we talk to db by writting SQL queries
fastAPI <------> database
create tables in the database yourself


ORM: we talk with ORM and it translates to SQL queries
        PYTHON        psycopg/SQL
fastAPI <------> ORM <------> database
define our tables as python models
sqlalchemy ==> most popular, still need to pip install a db that you want to use e.i. psycopg2, mysql
                cannot update the db with a new column, you need to delete the table then it will recreate it which cant be done in production ==> use migration tool like Alembic which works with sqlalchemy
auth: session based and jwt (stored in user client)
jwt: 
login(u,pass) to api --> api verify if valid --> sendback token to client
/post {token} --> valid token --> send data to client
Note: token is not encripted so be caareful sending cinfidential info
